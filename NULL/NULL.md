this code is from [[https://web.archive.org/web/20081007122040/http://dev.tokigun.net/esolang/null/nullrun.py]].
However, I have changed this code to make it a bit easier to execute. 
However, this code still runs on python 2. 
If you want to run it on [[https://tio.run]], please do so.

Here's how to use this code:
1. Input the factorized value of the code you want into the standard input.
(e.g. 42539 -> 7 * 59 * 103)
2. Run the code.
3. Then, the result of the code execution will appear in the standard output.
